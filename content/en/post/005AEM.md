title: "High-throughput Computationally Guided Low/high Index Optical Coupling Layer for Record-performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells"
---

Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) can be made in different colors, allowing light to pass through, and yet absorb enough visible and near-infrared (NIR) light to generate electricity. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high performing ST-OSCs over the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). In this work, we report our effort to develop record-performance ST-OSCs using a low/high index optical coupling layer (OCL) and a 2-D photonic-structured antireflective (AR) coating. High-throughput optical screening was used to improve understanding OCL structure−performance relationships and predicting NIR absorption enhancement for ST-OSCs. About 200 thousand different device configurations were simulated for optimizing the performance of ST-OSCs. The use of a low/high index Na3AlF6 (170 nm)/ZnS (110 nm) OCL and a 900 nm pitch-sized 2-D photonic-structured AR coating, fabricated using nanoimprint lithography, enables the record-performance ternary PM6:BTP-eC9:L8BO-based ST-OSCs, achieving simultaneously an impressive high PCE of 15.2%, a high AVT of 32%, a high light utilization efficiency of 4.86%, and a high color-rendering index of 82. The results of ST-OSCs demonstrated in this work provide an attractive option for a plethora of applications in self-powered greenhouses and building-integrated photovoltaic systems.
